# HealthCare-Monitoring-System
This project focuses on building a healthcare monitoring system that integrates an autoencoder along with various neural network models. The system's primary objective is to process healthcare data, perform feature extraction using an autoencoder, and utilize other neural network architectures for classification or anomaly detection tasks.

Features
Incorporates an autoencoder for unsupervised feature learning and dimensionality reduction.
Utilizes various neural network models:
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image-based data (if applicable).
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequential data analysis.
Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs) for classification or regression tasks.
Real-time data streaming and processing capabilities for continuous monitoring.
Customizable architecture for integrating diverse healthcare datasets.
Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow or PyTorch (for implementing neural networks)
Pandas, NumPy, and other required Python libraries as specified in requirements.txt.
